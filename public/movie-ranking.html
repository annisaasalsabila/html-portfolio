<h1>Annisa's Top 5 Movies</h1>
<h3>Here are some of my favorite movies!</h3>
<hr />
<h2>1. La La Land</h2>
<p>With its glamorous musical score, this movie portrays the realities of romantic relationships as they unfold in a realistically imperfect world.</p>
<h2>2. The Ring</h2>
<p>Inspired by Japanese mythology, the 2002 movie remains one of the most spine-tingling adaptations of supernatural horror stories.</p>
<h2>3. Atonement</h2>
<p>Adapted from Ian McEwan's novel set in the ush sprawling greens of England, Atonement is as beautiful as it is heartrending.</p>
<h2>4. Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings</h2>
<p>As much as it is an action-packed fantasy piece, this movie is a bittersweet representation of what it means to grow up under generational trauma and the love we learn to take from it all.</p>
<h2>5. Train to Busan</h2>
<p>Not a minute of dullness from this South Korean ensemble piece which is surprisingly adept at portraying the multiple faceets of humanity we find in every single individual.</p>
